# Machine Learning for Property Valuation
This repository contains the code for *C-Value*, a valuation estimate for private landed and non-landed properties and resale HDBs in Singapore generated using machine learning. See [this post on Data&Stuff](https://chrischow.github.io/dataandstuff/2019-09-15-machine-learning-for-property-valuation/) for the preliminary results.
